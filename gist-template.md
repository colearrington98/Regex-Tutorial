# Title (replace with your title)

In this regex tutorial aimed at web development students, we will dive deep into a specific regex pattern commonly used for email validation. By understanding the search pattern this regex defines, you will be able to validate email addresses more effectively in your web applications.

## Summary

The regex we will be focusing on in this tutorial is:

/^[\w-]+(.[\w-]+)*@([\w-]+.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$/

This pattern is used to validate email addresses by ensuring they follow the standard format, such as `example@example.com`.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are special characters in regular expressions that assert a specific position in the input string. The two main types of anchors are `^` (start of the line) and `$` (end of the line). In our email validation regex, `^` ensures that the pattern starts from the beginning of the input string, and `$` ensures that the pattern ends at the end of the input string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are used to specify the number of occurrences of a character or group in a regex pattern. In our email validation regex, `+` is used as a quantifier to ensure that there is at least one character in the local part and domain part of the email address.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are used to create subpatterns within a regex pattern. In our email validation regex, parentheses `()` are used to create subpatterns for the optional dot-separated local part and the domain labels.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are used to create a custom character class. In our email validation regex, `[a-zA-Z]` is a bracket expression that defines a custom character class containing uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Character Classes

Character classes represent a set of characters in a regex pattern. In our email validation regex, `\w` is a shorthand character class that matches any word character, which includes letters, digits, and underscores.

### The OR Operator

The OR operator is not used in our email validation regex, but it is an important concept to understand. The OR operator `|` is used to create alternation within a regex pattern, meaning it matches one of the alternatives specified.


### Flags

Flags are not used in our email validation regex, but they can modify the behavior of a regex pattern. Common flags include `g` (global), `i` (case-insensitive), and `m` (multiline).

### Character Escapes

Character escapes are used to represent literal characters in a regex pattern. In our email validation regex, the dot `.` is escaped using a backslash `\` to represent a literal dot character.
